PHP Client Library for the VWflow API

[VWflow](https://vwflow.com) is a cloud-based workflow automation platform for audiovisual content which allows companies to streamline all aspects of their online video presence. It comprises a customizable media player, a set of APIâ€™s and a multi-user Video Management System (VMS) allowing companies to administer their video, audio and image assets.

To start using VWflow, request a [free trial account](https://www.rambla.be/request-your-free-trial/) or contact support@vwflow.com.

This library makes it easy to interact with VWflow API. It depends on the [Requests for PHP](https://github.com/rmccue/Requests) library for handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Documentation
The VWflow REST API is **browseable and self-documented**. To get started quickly, you can use the different [API methods](https://vwflow.com/api/v1/) in your browser and inspect their response. When you write a client application, the API will behave in exactly the same way except for authentication (when using the API in your browser, you're already authenticated). Each method of the browseable API is also documented, with a 'Details' panel providing additional information.

In the [examples](https://github.com/vwflow/vwflow-php/tree/master/examples) directory, you can also find scripts showing basic interaction with VWflow.

## User Generated Content
The VWflow API has separate [items-hmac endpoints](https://vwflow.com/help/api_direct_uploads/) which allow you to let end-users directly upload files using an HTML form or XMLHttpRequest. This makes it possible for user generated videos to be **uploaded directly to VWflow, without an intermediate web-server or CMS**. The ID of the workflow profile that is part of the URL determines how the item will be processed by VWflow.

Client/server communication is protected by a message digest (HMAC) using a shared secret and additional data generated by the client. The client also sends a future timestamp along with every request, which limits the period that the request will be valid. To avoid replay attacks, the option to accept the same HMAC only once can be set.

The examples directory contains a [direct_upload](https://github.com/vwflow/vwflow-php/tree/master/examples/direct_upload) section with scripts that demonstrate how to generate forms for end-user uploads.

## Development
This PHP library is maintained by the VWflow team. It doesn't yet cover the complete API, but we plan to extend it based on our customer's needs. If you have a bug or feature request, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/vwflow/vwflow-php/issues/new).
